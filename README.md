## 🔐 Key Concepts Learned
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** hides your real IP and encrypts your data.
- VPNs use protocols like **OpenVPN**, **WireGuard**, and **IKEv2**.
- VPN ≠ complete anonymity — logs, DNS leaks, or browser fingerprinting can still reveal info.
- VPN affects speed slightly due to encryption overhead.

## ⚖️ VPN Benefits vs Limitations

| Benefits                        | Limitations                                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Hides IP address                | Slower speed                                 |
| Encrypts traffic (public Wi-Fi) | May not bypass censorship everywhere         |
| Avoids tracking & geo-blocks    | Free plans have limited servers/speeds       |
| Secure connection               | Trust depends on VPN provider's no-log policy |
